# DataDemo

Before starting the application, run `mvn install`.

Start the application either by running `org.vaadin.erik.Application` in your IDE or by running `mvn`. 

## jOOQ

For your convenience, the generated jOOQ metadata is checked into the repository.

It can be re-generated by running `mvn generate-sources -Pjooq`.

The application must have been started before this, giving Hibernate a chance to generate the database structure.
