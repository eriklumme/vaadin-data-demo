# DataDemo

Before starting the application, run `mvn install`.

Start the application either by running `org.vaadin.erik.Application` in your IDE or by running `mvn`. 

# The data views

Every data view implements the master-detail view in a different way. The should all support the same functinality, which is:
* List persons
* Sort  persons
* Insert a new person
* Update an existing person
* Throw an `OptimisticLockException` upon saving an existing entity if the version in the database is newer.

## jOOQ

For your convenience, the generated jOOQ metadata is checked into the repository.

It can be re-generated by running `mvn generate-sources -Pjooq`.

The application must have been started before this, giving Hibernate a chance to generate the database structure.
